Hey, I'm Azez. Computer science is my current adventure. I'm diving into Graphics Programming, Front-End Web Development (with a focus on UI/UX), and Android Development â€“ and honestly, I'm curious about everything! Building my skills and working to contribute without causing too much chaos. If you've got open projects and room for someone eager to collaborate, let's connect!
