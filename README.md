"Hey, I'm Azez. Basically, I'm figuring out this whole computer science and web development thing. Right now, I'm kinda obsessed with Graphic_Programming, Web_Dev, Android_Developer and probably many things to come!.
i'm trying not to break too much stuff. If you're working on any open projects and don't mind a newbie tagging along, hit me up."
